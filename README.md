# Programming For Mobile Devices

This is a brief construction of web pages using HTML and CSS3 as programming language. The questions came from my learning period as a specialist in programming for mobile devices in the postgraduate course at the Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Piau√≠ (IFPI).

## HTML

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language used to structure and display the content of web pages. It is the fundamental building block of most websites and provides the basic framework for organizing and formatting content such as text, images, videos and links. With HTML, developers can define the hierarchy of page elements using specific tags and attributes. This language allows you to create links between pages, create lists, tables, forms and apply basic styles. By combining HTML with CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript, it is possible to create interactive and visually appealing web pages. In short, HTML plays a key role in creating a consistent and structured browsing experience on the web.
